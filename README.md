# Final

## Overview
Fork this repository and read the information below.

As a group, identify the design specifications that you'll need to build the two pages within the "Design" folder. This includes fonts, font-size, color, grid structure, and more. Once you have completed the design specs, you will continue to *work as an individual* . The supplied designs artboards are too small. You will need to approximate font-size using your intuition. 

I've included static files for those of you who do not have Sketch. 

You will need to create a mobile layout on your own, without design specifications. 

## Assets
I've included font files for you to use in this project. You will need to use [@font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) for them to work. 

For images, feel free to use any placeholder images you think are appropriate for this project. 

## Requirements
